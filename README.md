# Kitten Story :heart_eyes_cat:

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.3. 

It's a very simple POC to learn how to use Angular. Here are the following features:
- 🐾 a form to add a kitten to an adoption list.
- :cat2: display of all the kittens available for adoption with their details.
- :kissing_cat: possibility of adopting the kitten that captures your heart. Once adopted, the kitten is added to the user personal list.

You can find a demo [here]
