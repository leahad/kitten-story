# Kitten Story :heart_eyes_cat:

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.3. 

This is a simple Proof of Concept I created to exercise my skills in Angular. Here are the key features:
- üêæ Kitten Adoption Form: to add a new kitten to the adoption list.
- :cat2: Kitten Adoption List: list of adorable kittens available for adoption, complete with their details.
- :kissing_cat: Fall in love with a kitten? You can adopt it and watch it join your personal adoption list.

You can find a demo [here](https://www.loom.com/share/d792b23d86924a19b05c7b86f72179f3?sid=58aca1a5-7966-48af-bf7d-8f4565d163f0).
